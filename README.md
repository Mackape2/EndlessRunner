# EndlessRunner Max PÃ¥lsson

This my submission for the endless runner assignment that we were given.

The binery is under the shipping package under the release tab as a ZIP program. 

## Part 1
The effectivness of my Program comes from the fact that most of the code have been compiled in a way that you only need to use three of them
to have them work coherantly work together in a way that is easy to set up and execute. 

Due to the code only demanding that you add the manager and submit the two actors that works as platforms and projectiles, it's quite easy to reuse or reconstuct
the base of the game without much effort need. And having used hard variable sparingly, adding parameters for the UI would be quite simple and make it even
more reusable.

The code for the manager has gone through a few optimizations to compact and enchance the code, which is evident by the excess code that has yet to be removed due
to safty reasons.

Due to inexperiance, a memory system is not yet implimented, but will have been added by the next deadline. 

##Part 2
